FULL-STACK framework?

pip install Django

set a new environment: django-admin startproject my_site

manage.py and urls.py are important

like a flask run (used to test): python manage.py runserver <optional port number>

to create the app: python manage.py startapp my_app

views.py store different views for the app (web pages)

on views.py:
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(response):
    return HttpResponse('hello world!')

create urls.py inside main (paths to different web pages)

on main/urls.py:
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index")
]

on my_site/urls.py:
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include("main.urls"))
]
